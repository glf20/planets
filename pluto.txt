Pluto - planet or asteroid?
You might consider including Pluto in this repositry as it was previously considered a planet.
I think its colder than Mars in the evening, therefore not a great holiday destination
I went last year, it wasn't very busy.
What other details should we add? Tourist potential? Sites worth visiting?
